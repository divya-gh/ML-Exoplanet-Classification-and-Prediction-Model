Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.2. Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.3. Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.4. Separate the data into training and testing data.	    ### Step 2 -Tune Model Parameters1. Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.2. Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.	### Step 3 - Reporting- Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).## Analysis __Preprocessing__ : Preprocessing involves feature engineering of dataset that selects minimum required features to produce a valid model because the more features makes the model susceptible to errors due to variance.- __Feature Selection Model__ : Yellowbrick The [Yellowbrick FeatureImportances](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/model_selection/importances.html) visualizer with sklearn RandomForestClassifier	* FeatureImportances uses a barplot to visualize the importance of each feature for prediction. 	* Out of 40 features, I have selected top 20 features of importance.![Feature Importance plot](./Images/RF_FeatureImportances.png)__Classifiers__: - __Logistic Regression__ :	* Training Data Score: 0.841	* Testing Data Score: 0.861	- __RandomForest Classifier__ :	* Training Data Score: 1.0	* Testing Data Score: 0.91	* Classification Report [Visualization with Yellowrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/classifier/classification_report.html)		![RF Classification Report ](./Images/RF_ClassificationReport.png)- __KNN - K Nearest Neighbor Classifier__ :	* Test Accuracy: 0.858	* Classification Report [Visualization with Yellowrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/classifier/classification_report.html)		![KNN Classification Report ](./Images/KNN_ClassificationReport.png)- __Decision Tree Classifier__ :	* Training Data Score: 0.894	* k=11 Test Accuracy: 0.888	* Classification Report [Visualization with Yellowrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/classifier/classification_report.html)		![DT Classification Report ](./Images/DT_ClassificationReport.png)- __SVM-Support vector machine Classifier__ :	* SVM Test Accuracy: 0.858	* __Hyperparameter Tuning__ : 		* grid.best_params_ : {'C': 50, 'gamma': 0.0001}		* grid.best_score_ : 0.869	* Classification Report [Visualization with Yellowrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/classifier/classification_report.html)		![SVC Classification Report ](./Images/svc_classification_report.jpg)	* Confusion Matrix [Visualization with Yellowrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/classifier/confusion_matrix.html)	![SVC Confusion Matrix ](./Images/SVC_ConfusionMatrix.png)### ConclusionWhile Random Forest and KNN scored 90% and 88% each on prediction, their training score is higher than the test score. This means that data is overfitted and model has memorized the features.I would prefer SVM with grid selection model as our preferred training model to classify and predict the exoplanets.## Technologies and Tools* Jupyter NotebookPython Libraries and tools:	* SKLearn 	* Yellowrick Visualization		## Code [Best Model](./Divya_Shetty.sav)## StatusProject Complete## Contact [Divya Shetty](https://github.com/divya-gh)
